# Lab Report 3

## Researching Commands

In this lab report, I will look more closely at the find command and explore the different ways in which it can be used to extract information from a directory with files and other subdirectories. In general, the find command is useful for searching files or directories. We can use it to execute a variety of tasks ranging from finding files of a specific type to files with a specific name.

### Use find with the name of the file

To find a file based on its name, the following command is run (all my commands are running using data from the skill-demo1-data directory and its subdirectories):

``` find -name WhatToJapan.txt```

### Using find with the extension of the file

```find written_2 -name *.txt > numberTextFiles```
